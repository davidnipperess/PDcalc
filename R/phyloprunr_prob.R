#' Pruning algorithm to maximise gains in expected Phylogenetic Diversity from
#' successfully managing threatened species
#'
#' A pruning algorithm that seeks to maximise gains in expected Phylogenetic
#' Diversity (PD) from successfully managing threatened species from a candidate
#' list. Starting with all candidate species being assumed to be successfully
#' managed, the algorithm proceeds by stepwise removal of species from the
#' candidate list that providing the smallest gain (from conservation) at that
#' step. The pruned candidate list at each step will be optimal for conserving
#' Phylogenetic Diversity for that number of species. The reverse order in which
#' species are pruned gives the priority for conservation.
#'
#' @param phy is a rooted phylogenetic tree with branch lengths stored as a
#'   phylo object (as in the \code{ape} package).
#' @param species is an optional \code{character} vector of species names (tree
#'   will be trimmed to match). Each species must match to a tip label in
#'   \code{phy}.By default, all tip labels in \code{phy} will be included.
#' @param managed is a \code{character} vector of species names to be included
#'   on the candidate list for conservation. Each name must match to a name in
#'   \code{species}. By default, all names in \code{species} will be included as
#'   candidates.
#' @param retain is an optional \code{character} vector of species names that
#'   are never pruned from the candidate list (i.e. always assumed to be
#'   conserved). Each name must match to to name in \code{managed}.
#' @param survival is a \code{numeric} vector of survival probabilities, given
#'   no management for conservation, corresponding to each species in
#'   \code{managed}.
#' @param feasibility is an optional \code{numeric} vector of probabilities of
#'   successfully managing each species in \code{managed}. By default,
#'   probability of success is assumed to be 1.
#' @param cost is an optional \code{numeric} vector of costs of conservation
#'   corresponding to each species in \code{managed}. Default value is 1 for all
#'   candidate species.
#' @param success is a \code{numeric} vector of length 1, giving the probability
#'   of survival of a species if successfully managed for conservation. Value
#'   must be less than 1.
#' @param random is a \code{logical} vector of length 1, indicating whether
#'   species should be pruned from the candidate list at random (\code{TRUE}),
#'   rather than optimally (\code{FALSE}).
#' @details \code{phyloprunr.prob} takes a phylogenetic tree (rooted and with
#'   branch lengths) and a list of candidate species for conservation and
#'   determines the optimal set of species that will maximise expected
#'   Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) for that set size, if those species were
#'   successfully managed for conservation. The algorithm determines step-wise
#'   which candidate species provides the smallest gain to expected PD and then
#'   removes it from the candidate list, adjusting the probabilities of survival
#'   of each branch in the tree as it goes. The algorithm will continue until
#'   the list of candidates is exhausted. At each step, ties are resolved by
#'   choosing at random from the available options. For this reason, the
#'   algorithm may need to be repeated to generate several equally optimal sets.
#'   An optional argument (\code{feasibility}) allows for the gain of conserving
#'   any species to be down-weighted by the probability that management will be
#'   successful. A further optional argument (\code{cost}) allows for gains to
#'   be divided by their respective costs.
#' @return A dataframe giving the names of each species pruned (in order of
#'   pruning), the expected Phylogenetic Diversity \emph{after} pruning that species,
#'   and the total cost of management (summed across managed species) \emph{after}
#'   pruning that species.
